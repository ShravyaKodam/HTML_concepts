        <p>Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that deals with collecting, analyzing, and interpreting huge volumes of data. Data has become the most useful resource today, and with the increasing generation of data, the demand for data scientists and data analysts has also increased. India is becoming the hub for data scientists, software developers, and engineers.

            Data science is the domain of using advanced analytics strategies and scientific principles to yank worthwhile knowledge from data for business decision-making, strategic planning, and different benefits. It's increasingly essential to businesses: The understanding that data science generates assistance organizations improve operational efficiency, recognizing unexplored business prospects, and enhancing marketing and sales agendas, among additional advantages. Eventually, they can lead to competitive advantages over business competitors.

        <p>
            <h2>Python Basics</h2>
            Here are the topics you need to learn in Python to master this programming language:
            <ol><!--ordered list-->
                <!--Nested list(example)
                    use: 
                    <ol type="a"></ol> for small alphabets
                    <ol type="A"></ol> for caps
                    <ol type="I"></ol> for romans
                    <ol type="i"></ol>
                    <ol type="a"></ol>-->
                    <!--Note: Here, using different types to learn, but should maintain same format through out the page-->                   
            <li>Start with the basics
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Data types</li>
                    <li>variables</li>

                </ol>
                </li>
            <li>Learn the different data structures in Python 
                <ul>
                    <li>List</li>
                    <li>Tuples</li>
                    <li>Dictionary</li>
                    <li>Sets</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Looping and conditional statements 
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>if</li>
                    <li>else</li>

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Understand how to write user-defined functions</li>
            <li>Understand the different built-in functions in Python</li>
            <li>I/O operations and exception handling</li>
            <li>Concepts of object-oriented programming</li>
            <li>Regular expressions, modules, generators, and iterators</li>
        </ol>
            After learning these topics, you can jump over to understand different data science libraries in Python.

            Some of the important ones are NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, and Tensorflow.
